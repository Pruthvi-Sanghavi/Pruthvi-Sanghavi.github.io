      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>Optimization of Autonomous Drone Delivery Systems/shared electric scooter/Vehicle fleet operations has become essential for the fleet owners to increase their revenue. Ride revenue can be increased 
      through the increase in the number of deliveries/rides per battery charge. One approach that is proposed in this project to achieve more scooter rides per charge is the 
      concept of pig tailing. An autonomous Drone/Electric vehicle can use the transit networks to move to the location of its request. The agent can sit on the transit or get inside the transit to save battery
      and reach the destination safely.</p>
      
        
        <p>The map shown here is a small area in Washington DC. Red triangles here represent scooter depots. Red path represent the transit routes and black paths indicate the path of the autonomous drone/electric scooter. </p>
      <h3>Assumptions</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>The number of drones/scooters/robots and the depots are constant.</li>
        <li>Transit networks are deterministic with respect to the locations and vehicle travel time.</li>
        <li>There is a capacity of transit networks to carry these scooters.</li>
        <li>Transit networks are unaffected because of this robot pigtailing.</li>
        <li>Drones/Electric scooters can be recharged in a negligible amount of time using swappable batteries.</li>
        <li>Depots have unlimited drone/scooter capacity.</li>
      </ol>
      <h3>Cases</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>When a customer calls an drone/electric scooter, the drone/scooter reaches there from the depot using pigtailing to optimize some cost.</li>
        <li>When a customer drops off the scooter after a ride, the scooter depending upon the charge it has should decide how to reach the depot.</li>
        <li>When the customer calls it not from the depot should it pigtail or go on its own picking up someone on the way increasing ride revenue.</li>
    </ol>
      <h3>Problem Formulation</h3>
        <center><img src="images/mp2/formulation.png" width="671" height="348"/></center>
        <p>Let the problem be formulated as follows:</p>
        <p>Size of the Drone/scooter fleet = <i>m</i></p>
        <p>Number of depots = <i>l</i> with the geographical locations given as <i>V<sub>d</sub>:= {d<sub>1</sub>, d<sub>2</sub>, d<sub>3</sub>,...,d<sub>l</sub>}</i>.</p>
        <p>Number of ride requests = <i>k</i> from the geographical locations given as <i>V<sub>c</sub>:= {c<sub>1</sub>, c<sub>2</sub>, c<sub>3</sub>,...,c<sub>k</sub>}</i>.</p>
        <p>where k>>m.</p>
        <p>Image shows the vertex set of the Allocation graph <i>G<sub>A</sub>(v<sub>A</sub>, E<sub>A</sub>)</i> which is <i>V<sub>A</sub> = V<sub>D</sub> &cup V<sub>P</sub></i>.</p>
      <h3>Datasets</h3>
      <p>For this project GBFS (General Bikeshare Feed Specification) dataset was used to know the station positions of the bikes and electric scooter in a small area in Washigton DC.
      <a href="https://nabsa.net/resources/gbfs/">Link to the GBFS website</a>. The station .json consists of the information about the latitude and the loongitude of the bike stations.
        Transit Data can be extracted from the GTFS Dataset which provides the file with the route coordinates of a transit vehicle. These data files are very large and a lot of computer processing went into it.
        So for this project, a toy data was created for the transit network route for the purpose of demonstration. The map is generated using a shape file of the road networks in washington DC downloaded from the
        Washington DC open source datasets.</p>
    <h3>Results</h3>
    <p>This project is not a strict implementation of the above research paper. The results generated in this project are some of the work towards my final project.
       This project is focussed towards loading the GBFS and GTFS datasets while also formulating the TSP algorithms while relieving some of the 
       constraints and finding the shortest path from depots to the scooters and also the interdepot travel sequence.</p>

    <h3>Challenges</h3>
    <p>The main challenges faced in the implementation are,</p>
    <ol>
        <li>The dataset sets used in the paper are massive and hence require a lot of processing.<li>

    </ol>
