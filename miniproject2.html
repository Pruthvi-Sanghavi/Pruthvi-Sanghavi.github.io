      <h3>Assumptions</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>The number of scooters and the depots are constant.</li>
        <li>Transit networks are deterministic with respect to the locations and vehicle travel time.</li>
        <li>There is a capacity of transit networks to carry these scooters.</li>
        <li>Transit networks are unaffected because of this robot pigtailing.</li>
        <li>Electric scooters can be recharged in a negligible amount of time using swappable batteries.</li>
        <li>Depots have unlimited scooter capacity.</li>
      </ol>
      <h3>Cases</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>When a customer calls an electric scooter, the scooter reaches there from the depot using pigtailing to optimize some cost.</li>
        <li>When a customer drops off the scooter after a ride, the scooter depending upon the charge it has should decide how to reach the depot.</li>
        <li>When the customer calls it not from the depot should it pigtail or go on its own picking up someone on the way increasing ride revenue.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Autonomous delivery robots and autonomous micromobility shared platforms offer flexible solutions to delivery and transportation sectors. But, these technologies face difficulties when it comes to the technical side of of the things.

      <h3>Paper Summary</h3>
      <h3>Problem Formulation</h3>
        <center><img src="images/mp2/formulation.png" width="671" height="348"/></center>
        <p>We operate a centralized homogeneous fleet of m electric scooters in a city scale domain. There are l depots with known geographical locations, denoted by V<sub>d</sub>:= {d<sub>1</sub>, d<sub>2</sub>, d<sub>3</sub>,...}. The depots serve as the scooter charging station as well as the scooter rider pickup station.</p>
