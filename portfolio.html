<!-- Project 1 Pick it up   -->
  <a href = "https://github.com/Pruthvi-Sanghavi/PickItUp"><p><font face="Ubuntu" size="4">PickIt Up</font></p></a>

  <p align="justify">This project leveraged the use of OMPL (Open Motion Planning Library) and Move it. The manipulator should exchange the positions of the red and the white block placed on two 
  tables avoiding an obstacle wall. This is carried out by motion interface tool in rviz. Using the toggle, the end effector of the robot is places at appropriate position in space
  and waypoint is obtained. Once all the waypoints are collected the path planning is executed using the OMPL library in rviz (A ROS based visualization tool) and then the entire 
  trajectory is simulated with real life physics in Gazebo. Code for the project can be found on the github link.</p>

  <p align="justify">The word APIS is the scientific name for honeybee. Insect flight, to an avid viewer appears to be much convoluted. The mechanics these insect uses are difficult to decipher. 
  In  sects such as honey bees, butterflies, dragonflies make use of extremely complicated wing motions and aerodynamics to steer themselves with agility.  Mimicking the natural model used by these insects and birds to construct micro robots becomes still more convoluted due to unavailability of very small actuators. Even if these actuators are made customarily, the control of wing movements mounted on these actuators is hard. 
  A large number of factors come into play when a dragonfly swooshes through its environment. A dragonfly has four wings connected to the muscles and each of which could be controlled independently. It consists of a pair of wings on each side: a front wing and a hind wing. A dragonfly uses time phase difference between the flapping of its front wings and hind wings to perform motions such as hovering, forward motion, backward motion and agile turning motion. 
  Recent advances in the field of bio robotics has led to the development of actuating methods which use electromagnetic waves [1], pressure waves [2], piezoelectric oscillators [3].
  In this paper, the concept of development of an acoustic actuator is discussed. In musical instruments such as guitar, violin; melodies are produced when a string is plucked or vibrated appropriately. Each string based on its length, tension which acts on it and linear density has a resonant mode of frequencies. When the string is vibrated with one of the values. of frequency matched by one of its mode, the string begins to vibrate violently with high amplitudes.
  In contrast to that, a resonator generating sound waves could be used to vibrate stings. This mechanical vibration of string due to resonance effect can be utilized for controlled robot motion.
  Thus, this motion would actuate extremely minute mechanisms.

  <p align="justify">Every object in this universe, depending upon its mass and spring (elastic) constant possess a set of value of natural frequencies. When the object is vibrated externally with these values of frequencies, the object vibrates with a very high amplitudes, this behaviour of an object is termed as Resonance.

  <p align="justify">The primary part of actuator are the resonators and the string. When signal from the micro-controller is provided to the resonators, the resonators vibrate. This vibration causes the strings to vibrate. The natural modes of frequency of the string depends upon the type of its material (density), tension and length. When the resonator is vibrated with a frequency corresponding to the first mode of vibration of string, the amplitude of vibration increases and resonance occurs. This vibrational energy can be used for doing work. 
  A honey bee (Apis Mallifera) is an agile flyer flapping its wings about 200 times /second. The figure shown above is a honey bee robot ‘APIS’. Like a real bee, this robot possesses two pairs of wings on each side: A primary wing and a secondary wing. When the resonators are vibrated with the fundamental harmonic frequency resonance occurs. This high amplitude vibration vibrates the wings in sync and as a result thrust is generated.
