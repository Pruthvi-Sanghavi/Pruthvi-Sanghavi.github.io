  <p align="justify">This project leveraged the use of OMPL (Open Motion Planning Library) and Move it. The manipulator should exchange the positions of the red and the white block placed on two 
  tables avoiding an obstacle wall. This is carried out by motion interface tool in rviz. Using the toggle, the end effector of the robot is places at appropriate position in space
  and waypoint is obtained. Once all the waypoints are collected the path planning is executed using the OMPL library in rviz (A ROS based visualization tool) and then the entire 
  trajectory is simulated with real life physics in Gazebo. Code for the project can be found on the github link.</p>
